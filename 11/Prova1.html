Tirone José González Orama (March 11, 1988 – January 20, 2015) known by his stage name Canserbero,[4][5] was a Venezuelan hip hop singer and songwriter from Caracas.[6] He was one of the most significant interpreters of non-commercial rap in his country and Latin America.[7] Since he was young he showed interest in music, mainly influenced by reggaeton but after the murder of his half brother, his musical references changed to more critical genres such as hip hop and hard rock, appreciable in songs like «Es épico».[8]

Canserbero, throughout his career, came to release two studio albums as a soloist, Vida (2010) and Muerte (2012) respectively,[9] and had several notorious songs such as «Pensando en ti», «C'est la mort», «Maquiavélico», among others.[8] He also participated as a vocalist in several songs of artists from Latin America and Spain as Mala Rodríguez, with whom he recorded a song entitled «Ella» (2013).[10] At the end of January 2015, Canserbero was found dead after having fallen from the apartment where he was resident. There are several hypotheses about his death.
