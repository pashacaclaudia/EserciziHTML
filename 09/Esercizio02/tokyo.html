		<p>Tokyo, officially Tokyo Metropolis (東京都 Tōkyō-to), one of the 47 prefectures of Japan, <br> has served as the Japanese capital since 1869.<br> As of 2014, the Greater Tokyo Area ranked as the most populous metropolitan area in the world.</p>
		<p>Tokyo is often referred to as a city but is officially known and governed as a "metropolitan prefecture", <br> which differs from and combines elements of a city and a prefecture, a characteristic unique to Tokyo. </p>
